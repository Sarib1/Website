               <h2>5th Fifa/EAFC</h2>
               <p1>Out of all the sport games, Fifa/EAFC is easily the most played and whilst it still retains its demeanor for being a 'pay to win' title, its popularity is undeniably a winner against other sport games and thus deserves a spot in the list. </p1>

               <h2>4th Call Of Duty</h2>
               <p1>Call of duty is a game that has players across many generations. With the franchise starting way back in 2003, they've created a game that everyones heard of and plays and is still going strong to this day.</p1>

               <h2>3RD GTA</h2>
               <p1>The gta games are one of the only games that can last over a decade with its most recent release coming out way back in 2013, it still retains a massive player base but its highly anticipated new release GTA 6 has one of the highest potentials to be the best game ever but until then the franchise will remain at the number 3 spot.</p1>

               <h2>2ND Elden Ring</h2>
               <p1>Elden Ring is a game that not many people are familiar with when it comes to its name. A modern souls game that brought back the idea of a souls type game, Elden Ring is a graphical and challenging marvel. It retains the harsh grind of the old souls games whilst also making it available to new players bringing people new and old back to souls games. </p1>

               <h2>1ST Red Dead Redemption 2</h2>
               <p1>RDR2 is a masterpiece. Its graphics are mind-boggling and its story is one of sacrifice, love and hardship. RDR2 allows you to see the difference in the characters over time and its this immersion that really sets it apart from other titles whether its blood being splattered on your jacket or an honour system so complex it puts you right there with the decisions.</p1>
